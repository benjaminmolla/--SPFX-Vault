# 🔐 SPFX Vault

**SPFX Vault** is a fully encrypted, GUI-based virtual file system built in Python. It lets you create vaults with unlimited nested folders and securely store files (images, videos, documents, and more) inside a custom `.spfx` container using AES-256 encryption and SHA-512 password hashing.

Designed as a digital fortress with a file explorer feel, it supports drag-and-drop importing, multi-file encryption, media previews, and seamless navigation—all wrapped in a standalone vault you can lock and unlock on demand.
